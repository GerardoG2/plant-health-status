1. Correlat trigger [oints with spikes
]
2. overlay actuator with binary on/off data
- temp actuator on but temperature not affected
- temp or other acutator not activating
- overlay cumulative actuator activations 

3. investigate if heater was active during temperature drops 

4. correlate nutrients with pump acitvation

5. What causes plant to grow exponentially 

6. time series regression

7. 4 day rolling averages on actuator conditions
- counts of activaations, etc

8. 1nn imputation for filling extra time stamps to overrlay actuator data 

temp during day 20 - 24 

temp during. night 18 - 22

twin x axis time series for actual environmental data 
-actua vs imputed 
maybe try scatter 

temporal forecasting with 
use ALL plants

do time series support vector regression


==================
02/06

1. Finish regression and SVR 
2. Clean github and organize notebook 
* Humidity and water temperature have strongest positively associated features with lettuce weight. 
* However, examining the confidence interval tells us that the coefficient of water temperature could be zero. We are 95% confident that humidity is a positive predictor of lettuce weight. 
* Adiditonally there is strong multicollinearity
* r sqaured and rmse is good 
* insignificant p values from report 
* add time series neural network model and compare results to OLS

============
02/13
* detailed report accumulating all analysis
* cldan github and add dr eshwar 
* change to lab name 
* add document to abstract 1 section on slack
